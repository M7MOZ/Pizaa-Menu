# PizzaMenu React Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the PizzaMenu React project! This project aims to create a website for a pizza restaurant, where users can view the menu and place orders. The unique feature of this project is that the menu items are only available during specific time intervals, and once a pizza is sold out, its picture turns to black and white.

## Features

- **Time-Dependent Menu:** The menu is available during specific time intervals. Outside these intervals, users won't be able to place orders.

- **Dynamic Image Effects:** When a pizza is sold out, its image transitions to black and white, providing a visual cue to users that the item is no longer available.
